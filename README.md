Toxic YouTube Comment Classification Using BERT
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify toxic comments on YouTube using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. The goal is to detect various types of toxicity, such as hate speech, offensive language, and personal attacks, in comments to create a safer and more inclusive online environment.
